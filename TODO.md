# TODO

## Reward System Improvements

- [ ] **Refine amusement tracking**: Update the reward calculation to evaluate emotional responses across the entire meme/sound duration rather than relying on a single frame snapshot. This should capture the full reaction arc (initial surprise, peak amusement, sustained laughter, etc.)

## Training

- [ ] **Run longer training sessions**: Complete extended training runs to allow the model to better learn preferences and explore more template/sound combinations

## UX Improvements

- [ ] **Make the whole system smoother**: Improve the overall user experience with smoother transitions, better visual feedback, and more polished interactions
